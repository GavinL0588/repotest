I hope I pass the test
I go to github-learning by doing cd github-learning
After I create the directory I make a file with README.md in the file by doung touch README.md
later I go to CSIDE 50 and put in echo "# repotest" >> README.md
If it works I do git init
I add the README.md file  git add README.md
I commit in the file by doing git commit -m "first commit"
And then I add the orgin git remote add origin git@github.com:GavinL0588/repotest.git
Lastly I do git push -u origin master to update the README.md text to show on my github account
